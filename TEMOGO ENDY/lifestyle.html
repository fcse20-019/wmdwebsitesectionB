Singapore's national language is Malay. There are four official languages in Singapore: Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil, and you'll probably also hear Singlish - the unique mix of Singapore's
        official languages and English. 75% of Singaporeans are ethnically Chinese,
        mostly from the Hokkien or Teochew communities. An estimated 6% of Singaporeans are Tamil,
        heralding from Southern India, and about 15% are Malay Muslims. That leaves 4% of Singaporeans
        with mixed or other heritage.

Singapore's flag is red and white with a crescent moon and five stars.
        The five stars symbolize five ideals - democracy, peace, progress,
        justice and equality - while the moon symbolizes a rising nation (it was founded in 1965).
        The white suggests purity while the red denotes the equality of mankind.

Singaporeans are very polite and there's a good reason for that. The government
        taught manners under the National Courtesy Campaign. While the manners campaign
        has been running since the 1970s, it got a rebranding in 2001, and is better known
        now as Singapore Kindness Movement.</p>
